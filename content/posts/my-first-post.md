title: 'Why I Started Writing'
---

2026 is shaping up to be another exciting year for AI and technology. One of my New Year’s resolutions is to start a personal website to document my learning journey and the “aha” moments I encounter along the way, both in technology and in life. So why writing, and why now?

Some might argue that large language models already explain technical concepts so well that writing blog posts no longer adds much value. I see it differently.Here are my reasons.

**Writing is thinking**

We live in an age of overwhelming information. Social media floods us with constant noise, fragmenting our attention and time. Writing, for me, is the most effective way to force focus on signal over noise. It is a deliberate process of clarifying thoughts and filtering what truly matters.

**Writing is learning**

Learning by doing is arguably the most powerful way to acquire new knowledge and skills, especially in science and technology. Writing allows me to scrutinize my own understanding and test whether I truly “get” what I’ve learned. It becomes a process of self-questioning, exploration, and internalization. Compared to passively reading papers or watching videos, writing helps me build a personalized knowledge system that deeply reinforces long-term memory.

**Writing is a peaceful state**

Work and life can be stressful. Like traveling or meditation, writing brings me a sense of calm and joy, helping offset unnecessary anxieties from work. It is a lifelong practice—one that can endure and continue to compound in value, even long after retirement.

**Writing is NOT teaching**

While readers may learn something from what I write, teaching is not my primary motivation. I am not trying to compete with AI in knowledge delivery or explanation. Writing, first and foremost, is for myself.

In short, writing helps me think better, learn deeper, and live more peacefully—over the long run.
